# PSDWriter

**PSDWriter** is a command-line tool that converts any common image format into `.psd` files for easy editing in Photoshop and seamless compiling with `vtex` in Source engine projects. It uses [`stb`](https://github.com/nothings/stb) for broad image format support and outputs Photoshop-compatible PSD files using [`psd_sdk`](https://github.com/MolecularMatters/psd_sdk).  It also automatically generates `vtex` configuration files using a built-in template for faster material setup.
